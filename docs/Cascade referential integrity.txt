Cascading Referencial Integrety

Optios when setting up Cascading referential integrity constraints:

If an attempt is made to delete or update a row with a key referenced by foreign keys in existing rows in 
other tables: 

1. No Action. This is is the default behaviour. An error will be raised and the DELETE or UPDATE
is rolled back.

2.Cascade.  All rows containing the those foreign keys are also deleted or updated.

3. Set NULL. All rows containing those foreign keys are set to NULL.

4. Set Default. All rows containing those foreign keys are set to default value.
